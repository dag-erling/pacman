## Exercises

# Exercise: Vertical Teleport

The teleporters are programmed to work only on the horizontal axis. Change the board to add teleporters at the top and
bottom row. This also requires a code change when teleporting happens. These new teleporters only need to function like
the existing teleporters and you do not need to add more than one on each row.

# Exercise: Generic Teleporting

In the game and the exercise above, the teleports are linked to each other. These systems are not very generic. Update
the teleporting system so that two teleport doors are linked with each other.

For example so you can enter a teleport from somewhere on the bottom row and exit from somewhere on the right column.

You do not need to allow for many teleports like this, only 2 doors.

# Exercise: Multiple Generic Teleporters

Continuation from above. Take the generic teleporting system you made and allow for more than 1 set of doors.

You might want to look into coloring/tinting each pair a certain color so the player will know what door leads to where.
