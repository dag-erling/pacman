# Exercise: Simple class

4. Create an empty class named `Clyde` within the `.hpp` file. Look at other ghost `.hpp` files and see how they define
   the class. It does not need to inherit from the `Ghost` base class and it does not need any functions. But if you
   have extra time, try to inherit from the Ghost class and see what happens when you try to compile.
