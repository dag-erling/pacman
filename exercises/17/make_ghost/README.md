# Exercise: Add Clyde as a Ghost

We have three ghosts within the project. Blinky, Inky and Pinky. But Clyde is missing. Implement Clyde and their
behavior.

Clyde always chases PacMan so the only thing you should need is where PacMan is currently located. But Clyde also has
the scatter behavior as the other ghosts.

Where are the graphics for Clyde in the assets file and how can we make sure the ghost will be correctly rendered?
